MySQL::Replication - Decentralised, peer-to-peer, multi-master MySQL replication

MySQL::Replication is a replacement for MySQL's built-in replication. The
reason for this module is that there are a number of issues with MySQL's
built-in replication:

  * You can't have multiple masters
  * There is a possibility of infinite replication loops
  * Time is wasted by time slicing
  * Queries may get replayed after a slave crash
  * Moving slaves to different masters is hard

MySQL::Replication solves these issues.
