WARNING: These tests should not be run in production.

Note that these tests were created to aid development and to test my
assumptions, so there might be a few things here (why and how) that do not make
any sense.

The MySQL::Replication::Server::GetQuery.t test script currently runs on
binlogs generated on my machine so it's not helpful to anyone else at the
moment. In the future I plan to automate creating test binlogs using
MySQL::Sandbox so that multiple versions of MySQL can be tested without the
contortions that I currently have to do in order to recreate them:

  - stop MySQL
	- set MySQL's log_bin to /tmp/test-bin.log
	- remove the old binlog in binlogs/
	- touch /tmp/test-bin.000032 so the next will be test-bin.000033
	- restart MySQL
	- import binlogs/get_query_test.sql
	- copy /tmp/test-bin.00003[345] to binlogs/
	- run make to recreate the binlog index
	- update positions and timestamps in
		- MySQL::Replication::Server::GetQuery.t 
		- MySQL::Replication::Test.pl

That last step is tedious. Adding "print Dumper( $Self )" in
MySQL::Replication::Server::GetQuery::BinlogReadHandler() will help you find
the positions you're looking for.
